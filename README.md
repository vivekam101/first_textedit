# ✏️ Text Edit ✏️

The mini text editor for people who want to focus on learning Python packaging. This text editor lets you:

+ Count the number of words, sentences, and characters in a file
+ Determine the [Colman-Liau readabilty index](https://readable.io/content/the-coleman-liau-index/)
+ Replace a phrase or string with another phrase
+ Change spacing between sentences from single space period to double space/period and backwards


## Installing

These directions are for OSX/Linux-based systems. Windows will be slightly different.

1. You'll need at least Python 3.6 to run Text Edit.
2. `git clone https://github.com/vivekam101/first_textedit.git`
3. `cd textedit`
4. Run `pip install .`
5. That's it! You're ready to use textedit.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.6
```

### Using the Package API

To import into your Python code:

`import first_textedit`

You can run the code interactively:
```
#Replace

python replace.py ../texts/alice.txt "Vicki" "Dora the Explorer"
Old Wordcount ('Words:', 274)
WC __name__: WC
New Wordcount ('Words:', 281)
parsefile __name__: __main__

#WordCount

mbp-vboykis:review vboykis$ python wordcount.py "../texts/alice.txt"
('Words:', 274)
('Sentences:', 7)
('Letters:', 1120)

# Readability

mbp-vboykis:review vboykis$ python readability.py "../texts/alice.txt"
('Reading Grade Level of Text:', 7)
```

Or, you can import it and use on a text file:

```
from review import readability  #import everything in the file named readability
from review.wordcount import WC #import classes specifically
from edit.spacing import Spacing
from edit.replace import Replace


test_file = '../texts/pool_of_tears.txt'

# Count words

print("Wordcount.py")
alice = WC(test_file)
WC.counts(alice)
print("\n")

# Readability Index
print("readability.py")
print(readability.colman_liau(test_file))
print("\n")

# Change Spacing
print("spacing.py")
sp = Spacing(test_file)
Spacing.spacing_check(sp)
print("Spaces replaced")
print("\n")

# Replace Words
print("replace.py")
Replace(test_file, "Alice", "Dora the Explorer")
print("Words replaced")
print("\n")

```

## Deployment

None! This is not a production-ready package. Install on your local machine and test it out and break things.
